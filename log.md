# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 1: October 16, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Gone through first bit of Flask introduction and set up the basic project structure in #100DayOfWebInPython.
Also, enabled Markdown formatting for posts in the Flaskr Blog app (as suggested in the "Keep Developing" section of the Flask tutorial).

**Thoughts** 
Have used Flask before, but the `.flaskenv` file using `python-dotenv` package to set the environment variable automatically is a nice addition to simplify the setup (and distribution I guess).
`markupsafe.escape()` can be used to sanitize user input on the sever side.

## Day 2: October 17, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
Started the day off with the rest of the Flask intro lessons on #100DayOfWeb in Python. 
Added templates, base template, and some MUICSS for styling and page consistency.

**Thoughts** 
Using `.html.j2` as the file extension for the Jinja2 templates makes SublimeText show them with correct syntax highlighting.

## Day 3: October 18, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
Started new Flask site from scratch. 
Site pulls Markdown files from my #100DaysOfCode journal repo on GitHub and renders them into a base template.
Styling of the page with MUICSS still open.

**Thoughts** 
In a Jinja base template, you can access a child templateâ€™s blocks not only by `{% block content %}{% endblock %}` but also via the special `self` object. 
To access the child's block use `{{ self.content() }}` in the parent/base template.
