# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 1: October 16, 2019, Wednesday

### Today's Progress
Gone through first bit of Flask introduction and set up the basic project structure in #100DayOfWebInPython.
Also, enabled Markdown formatting for posts in the Flaskr blog app (as suggested in the "Keep Developing" section of the Flask tutorial).

### Thoughts
Have used Flask before, but the `.flaskenv` file using `python-dotenv` package to set the environment variable automatically is a nice addition to simplify the setup (and distribution I guess).
`markupsafe.escape()` can be used to sanitize user input on the sever side.

## Day 2: October 17, 2019, Thursday

### Today's Progress
Started the day off with the rest of the Flask intro lessons on #100DayOfWeb in Python. 
Added templates, base template, and some MUICSS for styling and page consistency.

### Thoughts
Using `.html.j2` as the file extension for the Jinja2 templates makes SublimeText show them with correct syntax highlighting.

## Day 3: October 18, 2019, Friday

### Today's Progress
Started new Flask site from scratch. 
Site pulls Markdown files from my #100DaysOfCode journal repo on GitHub and renders them into a base template.
Styling of the page with MUICSS is still open.

### Thoughts 
In a Jinja base template, you can access a child templateâ€™s blocks not only by `{% block content %}{% endblock %}` but also via the special `self` object. 
To access the child's block use `{{ self.content() }}` in the parent/base template.

## Day 4: October 19, 2019, Saturday

### Today's Progress
Applied some style to my Flask journal app with MUICSS. 
Also, I added the Flask journal app to [my personal website](https://lpld.io) ðŸ˜Š

### Thoughts
The documentation of MUICSS and the features all seem a little less polished then the Bootstrap competition.
Especially the concept of `mui-appbar` is not quite clear, because there is no example on how to combine it with other elements.

Figuring out how to deploy the Flask app on my website took actually the most time. 
Couldn't figure out how to do it via unix socket as it was suggested on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04#step-4-%E2%80%94-configuring-gunicorn) . 
So now I am running the Gunicorn server and proxying from Nginx to it.

## Day 5: October 20, 2019, Sunday

### Today's Progress
Today no planned activity in #100DaysOfWeb course today, only video. 

To still code a bit, I continued Flask tutorials "Keep Developing" section by implementing an RSS Feed for new posts.  
This should be interesting, because I really never never worked with RSS. 
Neither on client nor server side. 

This concludes the proposed topics in the Flask tutorial "Keep Developing" section. 

### Thoughts
RSS seems pretty simple. Just an `.xml` file that is regularly polled by an interested reader.
But, is anybody still using RSS (as a user)?

## Day 6: October 21, 2019, Monday

### Today's Progress
Recreated the Google landing page from 1998 with HTML. 

### Thoughts
Client side form input validation is pretty helpful, because it is immediate.
It doesn't replace server side validation, but is helpful in it's responsiveness.

## Day 7: October 22, 2019, Tuesday

### Today's Progress
Made the recreated 1998 Google landing page responsive ðŸ˜Š

### Thoughts
Images create a strange space below it. No padding or margin set. This can be removed when setting `display` to `block`.

## Day 8: October 23, 2019, Wednesday

### Today's Progress
Spent a bunch of time trying to contribute to `wemake-python-styleguide` to add a clarification in the documentation. #Hacktoberfest

Created register form for responsive 1998 Google landing page for #100DaysOfCode. 

### Thoughts
`flake8` was running slow an throws a bunch of warnings in `wemake-python-styleguide`. 
Not sure if this is normal or caused by my setup. 

Working on a linter, that uses several linters and linting packages and also lints itself if kind of a brain fuck ðŸ˜¬

## Day 9: October 24, 2019, Thursday

### Today's Progress
Learned basics of API Star and Postman #100DaysOfWeb @TalkPython @Pybites.
Implemented cars API with read all, read one and create new car endpoints.


### Thoughts
The API Star version used (0.5) seems outdated and the package has been massively remodelled in its following release (0.6).

## Day 10: October 25, 2019, Friday

### Today's Progress
Continued learning about API Star and testing with `pytest. 
Extended the car API with update and delete features and added testing for all endpoints. #100DaysOfWeb @TalkPython @Pybites

### Thoughts
I do like the simplicity of `pytest` alot! Better than the class definition used by `unittest`.

No idea what kind of API to build in the next two days so far.

## Day 11: October 26, 2019, Saturday

### Today's Progress
Started creation of simple users API with API star for #100DaysOfWeb @TalkPython @Pybites
Applied TDD by writing the functions with `pytest` first.
Read for all and one is implemented. Next is Create, Update and Delete.

### Thoughts
The change in API Star resulted in them overhauling the documentation. 
Could not find the documentation for 0.5 anymore.
