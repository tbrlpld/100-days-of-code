**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Day 1: October 16, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Gone through first bit of Flask introduction and set up the basic project structure in #100DayOfWebInPython.
Also, enabled Markdown formatting for posts in the Flaskr Blog app (as suggested in the "Keep Developing" section of the Flask tutorial).

**Thoughts** 
Have used Flask before, but the `.flaskenv` file using `python-dotenv` package to set the environment variable automatically is a nice addition to simplify the setup (and distribution I guess).
`markupsafe.escape()` can be used to sanitize user input on the sever side.
