# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

I will code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.

If you are not familiar with the #100DayOfCode challenge, check out the [official site of the #100DaysOfCode movement](http://100daysofcode.com/).
Also, see the [rules](/rules.md) and [FAQ](/FAQ.md) pages.

During these 100 days I will be working through the projects defined in the [#100DaysOfWeb in Python course](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talkpython/100daysofweb-with-python-course/) by [TalkPython](https://www.talkpython.fm/) and [PyBites](https://www.pybit.es/).
The official #100DaysOfCode rules state that time spent on online courses, tutorial etc. does not count into your daily hour.
Part of the "#100DaysOfWeb in Python" course are videos that explain a certain technology.
I will not count the time spent watching the videos.
But, I will count the time working on the projects that are defined in the "#100DaysOfWeb in Python" course, which make use of the technology introduced in the preceding video.

If you are interested, check out the [log](/log.md) where I journal my progress.
I will also tweet short summaries of my daily progress.
My twitter handle is [@tbrlpld](https://twitter.com/tbrlpld).
